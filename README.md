# Music Arrow Game
 
This is a project inspired by [Hagrid](https://github.com/AnkanGranero/synthgoblin), an amazing and creative grid sequencer made by [Andreas](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb_fE048aSG9yULuNCYUV2A), a dude that often appears in the videos of [Simon The Magpie](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnbfRvqQcfw3eL71HfjROOQ)'s youtube channel, [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WQpYU6U89k) for example.  
Hagrid is an online grid sequencer where you can play here: https://hagrid-sequencer.netlify.app/

After watching Andrea's youtube video [I created a new kind of sequencer! Hagrid!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1wNKYQ2q2o) in Nov 2020,  
I was amazed by its design and ideas, so I planned to make a stand-alone software to run a game that has some similarities with Hagrid.
